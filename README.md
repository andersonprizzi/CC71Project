# CC71
This project, named C Compiler 71, is a C language compiler currently under development. It incorporates lexer, parser, and code generation stages, and is based on a grammar authored by the creator, inspired by Jeff Lee's ANSI C grammar.

The formal grammar defining the basis of this project can be found in the GRAMMAR.md file.

## Structure
Overview of the projectâ€™s directory layout, detailing how source code, headers, data, and scripts are structured.

- `headers/`: Header files (`.h`) for the compiler modules.
- `sources/`: Source code files (`.c`) implementing compiler functionality.  
- `data/`  
  - `input/`: Input source files for compilation.
  - `output/`: Output files generated by the compiler.
- `scripts/`: Build and run scripts for different platforms.  



## Build
On Windows, to build the project, run:
```bat
./scripts/build_on_windows.bat
```

If the build is successful, you will see the message:
```bat
Build successful.
```

Otherwise, if the build fails, you will see:
```bat
Build failed.
```

## Run
On Windows, to execute the compiler, run:
```bat
./scripts/run_on_windows.bat
```



## Usage
The compiler expects two command-line arguments:

```bat
<compiler_executable> <input_source_file> <output_file>
```

## Notes
- Ensure that `gcc` is installed and available in your system's PATH environment variable.
- This project is a work in progress and may not yet support the full C language specification.
- Contributions, bug reports, and suggestions are welcome and appreciated!
